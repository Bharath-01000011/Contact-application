# Contact-application
In this JAVA project, I've created a basic application to manage Contacts Information(first name, last name, address, phone, email) with MySQL database using NetBeans IDE.

1.In the first form, the user will see the Login Form. If the user is already registered, he/she can Log in with his Username And Password. If not then the user can create a New Account by clicking
"Register" label

2.When the User logins successfully, a new JFrame will show up with his profile picture and username. In the form, all his Contacts will be displayed into a JTable.

3.The User can:

- Add a New Contact
- Edit existing Contact
- Delete Existing Contact
- Get Selected Contact from JTable to TextFields and the Image into JLabel
- Navigate from Contact to another Using Navigation Buttons
