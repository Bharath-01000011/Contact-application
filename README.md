# Contact-application
In this JAVA project, I've created a basic application to manage Contacts Information(first name, last name, address, phone, email) with MySQL database using NetBeans IDE.
1 - In the first form, the user will see the Login Form. If the user is already registered, he/she can Log in with his Username And Password. If not then the user can create a New Account by clicking
"Register" label
2 - When the User logins successfully, a new JFrame will show up with his profile picture and username. In the form, all his Contacts will be displayed into a JTable.
3 - The User can:
                       - Add a New Contact
                       - Edit existing Contact
                       - Delete Existing Contact
                       - Get Selected Contact from JTable to TextFields and the Image into JLabel
                       - Navigate from Contact to another Using Navigation Buttons
